<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia Absorption Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plate Tower</li><li>Spray Tower</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ammonia Absorption Tower market includes two main types: Plate Tower and Spray Tower. Plate Tower features vertical plates that enhance the contact between ammonia and absorption liquid, allowing efficient absorption of ammonia gas. On the other hand, Spray Tower uses spraying nozzles to disperse the absorption liquid into fine droplets, which maximize the contact area with the ammonia gas, leading to effective absorption. Both types offer solutions for removing ammonia gas by facilitating its absorption into a liquid phase, but they differ in their design and method of facilitating the absorption process.</p></p>
