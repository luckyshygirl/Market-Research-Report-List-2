<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PD-1/PD-L1</li><li>CTLA-4</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a type of immunotherapy used to treat various cancers. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors work by blocking the interaction between PD-1, a protein on the immune cells, and PD-L1, a protein on cancer cells, thereby helping the immune system fight cancer. CTLA-4 inhibitors target the CTLA-4 protein on immune cells, enabling enhanced immune responses against cancer. These ICIs have revolutionized cancer treatment by unleashing the body's immune system to destroy cancer cells and have shown promising results in clinical trials for a range of cancer types.</p></p>
