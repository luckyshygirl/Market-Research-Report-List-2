<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Conduit</li><li>With Conduit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical heart valves are devices used to replace damaged or diseased heart valves. They can be classified into two types: without conduit and with conduit. Without conduit valves are designed to directly replace the diseased heart valve without requiring any additional structures. On the other hand, with conduit valves involve the use of additional conduits or tubes to connect the mechanical valve to the heart. Both types aim to improve heart function and alleviate symptoms of valve diseases by facilitating normal blood flow.</p></p>
