<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pellet Cooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Type</li><li>Vertical Type</li><li>Counterflow Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pellet coolers are used in the wood pellet industry to lower the temperature of pellets after the drying process. There are three types of pellet coolers: horizontal, vertical, and counterflow. Horizontal coolers have a horizontal layout, allowing for even pellet flow and cooling. Vertical coolers have a vertical layout, which enables efficient cooling due to pellet movement against gravity. Counterflow coolers have an opposite flow arrangement, ensuring optimum cooling by countering the direction of pellet movement. These different types cater to various production capacities, cooling requirements, and space constraints in the wood pellet industry.</p></p>
