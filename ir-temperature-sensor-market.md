<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IR Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact IR Temperature Sensor</li><li>Non-contact IR Temperature Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IR temperature sensor market consists of two types: contact IR temperature sensors and non-contact IR temperature sensors. Contact IR temperature sensors measure the temperature by physical contact with the object being measured, using a thermocouple or RTD probe to detect the temperature. On the other hand, non-contact IR temperature sensors measure the temperature remotely without physical contact. They detect the infrared radiation emitted by the object and convert it into temperature readings. Both types have their applications and suitability depending on the specific requirements and conditions of temperature measurement scenarios.</p></p>
