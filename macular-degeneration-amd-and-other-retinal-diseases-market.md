<p><strong>The Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Other Retinal Diseases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Macular Degeneration</li><li>Diabetic Macular Edema</li><li>Diabetic Retinopathy(DR)</li><li>Retinal Vein Occlusion</li><li>Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD)</li><li>Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (dAMD)</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal diseases refer to a group of eye conditions that affect the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. Types of retinal diseases include macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vein occlusion, wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), and other retinal diseases. Macular degeneration is characterized by the gradual loss of central vision, while diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy are common complications of diabetes. Retinal vein occlusion occurs when a vein in the retina is blocked, leading to vision impairment. Wet AMD involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels beneath the macula, causing leakage and scarring, while dry AMD is characterized by the gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in the macula. Other retinal diseases encompass various conditions affecting the retina, such as retinal detachment, macular hole, and epiretinal membrane.</p></p>
