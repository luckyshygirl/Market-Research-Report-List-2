<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DDoS Attack Protection Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud-based</li><li>On-premises</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DDoS attack protection services can be classified into two types: cloud-based and on-premises. Cloud-based protection services involve deploying the protective measures in the cloud, away from the target network. This method offers scalability and flexibility, as the service provider can handle large volumes of traffic and mitigate attacks remotely. On the other hand, on-premises protection services involve installing dedicated hardware or software within the organization's network infrastructure to detect and counter DDoS attacks. This method provides more control and customization options but may require additional investment in infrastructure and maintenance.</p></p>
