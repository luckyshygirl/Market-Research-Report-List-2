<p><h1>Implanted Stent Market Provides a Comprehensive Analysis Including a Macro Overview of the Market as well as Micro Details such as Market Size and Competitive Landscape</h1></p><p><strong>Implanted Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>An implanted stent is a small, flexible tube-like device made of metal mesh that is inserted into a blood vessel or other duct in the body to restore normal blood flow or provide structural support. It is commonly used in patients with blocked or narrowed arteries to keep the arteries open and prevent further complications such as heart attacks or strokes.</p><p>The global implanted stent market has been experiencing steady growth due to several factors. The rise in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, is one of the major drivers of market growth. Additionally, advancements in stent technologies, such as drug-eluting stents that release medication to prevent the re-narrowing of arteries, have further fueled the market expansion.</p><p>Furthermore, the growing aging population and the adoption of sedentary lifestyles have increased the demand for implanted stents. However, the market growth is hindered by factors like high costs associated with stenting procedures and the risk of complications such as stent thrombosis.</p><p>In terms of trends, there is an increasing preference for biodegradable stents that slowly dissolve and are eventually absorbed by the body. These stents eliminate the need for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy, reducing the risk of bleeding complications. Another emerging trend is the development of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS), which provides temporary support to the blood vessel until it heals completely.</p><p>The Implanted Stent Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period. Factors such as technological advancements, increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, and the introduction of innovative products are likely to drive market growth. However, challenges such as high costs and the risk of complications need to be addressed to sustain the growth momentum.</p></p>
