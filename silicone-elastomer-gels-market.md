<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Elastomer Gels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volatile</li><li>Non-Volatile</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Silicone elastomer gels can be classified into volatile and non-volatile types in the market. Volatile silicone elastomer gels have a low boiling point, meaning they easily evaporate when exposed to air or heat. They provide a temporary and lighter texture when applied, making them suitable for products with a quick-drying or cooling effect, like sunscreens or facial sprays. On the other hand, non-volatile silicone elastomer gels have a higher boiling point, allowing them to remain on the skin for longer periods. These provide a more long-lasting and moisturizing effect, making them ideal for products like moisturizers or body lotions.</p></p>
