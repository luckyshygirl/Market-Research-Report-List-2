<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PFO Occluder Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Degradable PFO Occluder</li><li>Degradable PFO Occluder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PFO occluder device market consists of two types: non-degradable and degradable PFO occluders. Non-degradable occluders are made of permanent materials that remain in the patient's body indefinitely. These devices offer long-term closure of the patent foramen ovale (PFO), a condition where a hole exists between the heart's chambers. On the other hand, degradable occluders are designed to gradually biodegrade over time, offering temporary closure until the hole naturally closes. Both types aim to treat PFO and prevent complications such as stroke or migraine.</p></p>
