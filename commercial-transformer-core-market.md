<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Transformer Core Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steel Laminated Cores</li><li>Solid Cores</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial transformer core market consists of two main types: steel laminated cores and solid cores. Steel laminated cores are made by stacking thin layers of steel sheets together, which are then coated and bonded with an insulating material. These cores are widely used due to their high efficiency and low production cost. On the other hand, solid cores are made from a single piece of steel with no gaps or laminations, providing better magnetic properties and reducing losses. However, their production cost is higher compared to laminated cores.</p></p>
