<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Fabric Printing Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sublimation Inkjet Printing</li><li>Direct to Fabric Printing</li><li>Direct to Garment Printing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital fabric printing machines market is divided into three types: sublimation inkjet printing, direct to fabric printing, and direct to garment printing. Sublimation inkjet printing involves the transfer of ink onto a special paper, which is then transferred onto the fabric using heat, resulting in high-quality, durable prints. Direct to fabric printing eliminates the need for paper transfer and allows ink to directly penetrate the fabric, providing vibrant, detailed prints. Direct to garment printing is similar to direct to fabric printing but is specifically designed for printing on finished garments, enabling customization and quick production.</p></p>
