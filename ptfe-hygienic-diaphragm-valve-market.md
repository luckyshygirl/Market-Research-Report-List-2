<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTFE Hygienic Diaphragm Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weir Type</li><li>Weirless Radial Diaphragm Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTFE Hygienic Diaphragm Valves are available in two main types: Weir type and Weirless Radial Diaphragm type. Weir type valves feature a diaphragm that seals against a raised weir, which helps to minimize dead space and reduce product entrapment. On the other hand, Weirless Radial Diaphragm valves use a diaphragm that seals against a flat surface, eliminating the risk of entrapment and making the valve easier to sterilize. Both types of valves are designed for hygienic applications in industries such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and biotechnology.</p></p>
