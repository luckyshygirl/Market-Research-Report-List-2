<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monocrystal Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lifting Furnace</li><li>Floating Zone Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Monocrystal Furnace market is divided into two types: Lifting Furnaces and Floating Zone Furnaces. Lifting Furnaces are designed with a lifting mechanism that allows for the vertical movement of the material being processed. This type of furnace is commonly used for growing large-sized monocrystals. On the other hand, Floating Zone Furnaces utilize a high-frequency induction heating system to melt a small region of the material, which forms a molten zone. This molten zone is then moved through the crystal, creating a process known as zone melting. Floating Zone Furnaces are mainly used for refining monocrystalline materials.</p></p>
