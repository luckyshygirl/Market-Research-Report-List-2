<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emitting Layer (EML)</li><li>Hole Transport Layer (HTL)</li><li>Electron Transport Layer (ETL)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OLED materials market comprises three main types of materials: Emitting Layer (EML), Hole Transport Layer (HTL), and Electron Transport Layer (ETL). The EML is responsible for producing light when an electric current passes through it. The HTL facilitates the movement of positive charges (holes) from the anode to the EML. On the other hand, the ETL enables the movement of negative charges (electrons) from the cathode to the EML. These materials are crucial in OLED technology as they work together to create the desired light emission.</p></p>
