<p><h1>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market Research Report Provides thorough Industry Overview, which offers an In-Depth Analysis of Product Trends and New Market Divisions</h1></p><p><strong>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) is a type of dialysis that is used to treat end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in which the patient's peritoneal membrane acts as a natural filter to remove waste and excess fluid from the body. Unlike hemodialysis, which requires a machine and is performed in a healthcare facility, CAPD allows patients to perform dialysis at home.</p><p>CAPD involves the continuous infusion and drainage of a sterile dialysis solution through a catheter into the peritoneal cavity. The dialysis solution absorbs waste products and excess fluid, which is then drained out of the body. The procedure is performed multiple times a day and does not require the use of a machine. It provides patients with greater flexibility and freedom compared to other forms of dialysis.</p><p>The Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. The increasing prevalence of end-stage renal disease, advancements in peritoneal dialysis technology, and the growing preference for home-based dialysis treatments are driving market growth. Additionally, the convenience and cost-effectiveness of CAPD compared to hemodialysis are contributing to its adoption.</p><p>Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an increased demand for CAPD as it reduces the risk of exposure to the virus in healthcare facilities. This has further propelled the market growth.</p><p>In conclusion, the Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market is experiencing steady growth and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 14.4% during the forecast period. The market is driven by factors such as the rising prevalence of end-stage renal disease, technological advancements, and the preference for home-based dialysis treatments. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the demand for CAPD.</p></p>
