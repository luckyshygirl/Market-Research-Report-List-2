<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrafiltration Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less than 0.002μm</li><li>Greater than 0.002μm</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ultrafiltration equipment is categorized into two types based on the size of the membrane pore: less than 0.002μm and greater than 0.002μm. In the less than 0.002μm market, the membrane pore size is extremely small, allowing only small molecules and ions to pass through while rejecting larger particles. This type of equipment is suitable for applications requiring high purity filtration, such as the removal of viruses and colloids. Conversely, in the greater than 0.002μm market, the membrane pore size is larger, allowing for the filtration of bigger molecules and particles while retaining smaller substances. This type of equipment is commonly used in separation processes, such as the concentration of proteins and the removal of suspended solids.</p></p>
