<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Calcium Carbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Process</li><li>Wet Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Heavy calcium carbonate is a versatile material used in various industries. It is produced through two different processes: dry process and wet process. In the dry process, limestone is burnt to produce calcium oxide, which is then slaked with water to produce calcium hydroxide. This is treated with carbon dioxide to generate heavy calcium carbonate. On the other hand, the wet process utilizes calcium carbonate suspended in water, followed by carbonation to form the final product. Both processes have their specific applications and market demand within industries like paper, plastics, and construction.</p></p>
