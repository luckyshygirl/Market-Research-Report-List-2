<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infusion Therapy Needleless Connector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Fluid Displacement</li><li>Negative Fluid Displacement</li><li>Neutral Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Infusion Therapy Needleless Connector market consists of three main types: Positive Fluid Displacement, Negative Fluid Displacement, and Neutral Displacement. Positive Fluid Displacement connectors ensure the flow of fluid by creating a positive pressure, which eliminates potential air entry. Negative Fluid Displacement connectors work by withdrawing fluid, preventing air from entering the system. Neutral Displacement connectors are designed to prevent backflow and infiltration by allowing fluid to flow freely without displacing any fluid or air. These different types of connectors offer various benefits and cater to specific infusion therapy needs.</p></p>
