<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alcohol Breath Testing Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fuel Cell Type</li><li>Semiconductor Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alcohol Breath Testing Equipment market consists of two main types: Fuel Cell Type and Semiconductor Type. In the Fuel Cell Type, alcohol in the breath is oxidized, producing a chemical reaction that generates an electrical current. This current is measured and used to determine the alcohol content. On the other hand, the Semiconductor Type uses a semiconductor sensor to detect alcohol molecules by their electrical conductivity. Both types provide accurate alcohol breath testing, with the Fuel Cell Type being more commonly used due to its higher accuracy and specificity.</p></p>
