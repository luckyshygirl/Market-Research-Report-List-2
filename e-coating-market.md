<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cathodic</li><li>Anodic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>E-coating, also known as electrocoating or electro-deposition coating, is a method used to apply a protective layer of paint onto surfaces through an electric current. There are two types of e-coating markets: cathodic and anodic. In cathodic e-coating, the metal to be coated acts as the cathode, attracting positively charged paint particles. This process provides enhanced corrosion resistance. In anodic e-coating, the metal acts as the anode and attracts negatively charged paint particles. This type of e-coating offers increased color options and improved decorative appearance.</p></p>
